# pf_learning
This is the APP that I used to learning porous flow module of MOOSE.

# 00.Mesh
Mesh has been created.

# 01.Single fluid
The simple simulation of single fluid injection into an aquifer has been created.

# 02.Numerical issues has been checked

# 03.Heat transfer
The simple simulation with added heat advection and conduction has been created.

# 04.Solid mechanics
The solid mechanics is added to the basic simulation.
In paraview, warp mesh by displacement vector can show the shaoe change of the model.

# 05.Real fluid EOS
The real water equation of state is used to calculate fluid properties.

# 06.Tracer
The tracer is added to the moddel.
